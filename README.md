# flutter_weather_app

I have developed a weather application using an API. The application includes a Lottie Splash screen, a service, and an API. Initially, we are greeted with a screen and after 3 seconds, we transition to the main screen. The application provides 7-day data for only one city, which refreshes itself every day. Additionally, there is a refresh button in the application that allows you to update the data with new information from the API.

Api => https://www.weatherbit.io/
Lottie Json file => https://lottiefiles.com/
